        <h1>This article is about the family of sports. For specific sports and other uses, see Football (disambiguation).</h1>
        <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the
        word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly
        called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and
        sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand);</p>
        <p2>There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football". It is widely assumed that the word "football"
        (or the phrase "foot ball") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.[13] There is an alternative explanation,
        which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe that were played on foot.[14] There
        is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.</p2>



        <h2>Football players</h2>





        <p3>Football is an ever-changing meritocracy and, therefore, deciding the best player in the world at any precise moment is
        a difficult challenge. That title could theoretically change hands after any given match depending on the level of
        performance an individual footballer has produced, and yet allowing opinions to change with such volatility would lead
        to nothing but subjective anarchy.
        
        For those within that bracket, it then becomes a question of clear evidence of immaculate form - whether that's goals,
        assists, clean sheets or passing the eye test for all-round play - and perhaps most importantly, who and in what
        competition that has been delivered against. But also crucial is how much you've got to show for playing well. While
        ability, form and overall impact are integral considerations, winning silverware is a vital ingredient for these Ballon
        d'Or contenders.
        
        Ranking factors
        So, how exactly do we name the best player in the beautiful game at this very minute? Our criteria are as follows:
        
        Recognised as being world-class: To be the best player in the world at the moment, you have to first and foremost.
        Well-respected: Be established as a top-level talent but also have.
        Consistent: Produced the goods consistently throughout an extended period.

        Erwin Helmchen could have scored 989 goals in his career.[3]
        Including friendly matches and competitions.
        Erwin Helmchen could have scored 870 club goals.
        According to other sources, Bican could be the leader with 728 goals.
        Including other categories than top-tier division, except regional and local leagues.
        Erwin Helmchen scored 713 goals of which 690 in German regional leagues.[10]
        Pelé scored the vast majority of his goals in Campeonato Paulista, but Série A still wasn't the top-tier league in
        Brazil in those years. If we exclude that goals, Cristiano Ronaldo would be the record holder with 572 goals.[13]
        Erwin Helmchen scored at least 667 goals with PSV Chemnitz in official matches; it's very likely that due to the lack of
        reliable information he hasn't surpassed officially the amount Messi reached but actually he did it.[19] Counting all
        matches in one club, Gerd Müller scored 1256 goals for Bayern Munich.[20][21]
        805 goals in 530 games played.
        According to RSSSF, Erwin Helmchen leads this category with 1.71 goals per game. Other sources mention Fernando Peyroteo
        with 1.77 goals per match but they only count his goals in Portuguese First Division National Championship.
        Godfrey Chitalu is claimed to have scored 109 official goals in 1972 for Kabwe Warriors and Zambia. However, the
        officiality of this tally is disputed.[27][28][29][30] Other sources, such as FIFA, name Pelé as the best in this
        category with 127 goals scored in 1959, but this amount includes goals in friendly matches.[31]
        This tally includes 35 goals at regional and local cups, which are in any case official competitions.
        At top-level football, excluding regional and local competitions, the most widely recognized record is Lionel Messi's 73
        goals for Barcelona during the 2011–12 season.[35][36] Godfrey Chitalu is also claimed to have scored 97 official goals
        in the 1972 season for Kabwe Warriors. However, the officiality of this tally is disputed.[27]
        The Guinness World Records also named Dixie Dean with 60 goals in 39 games in 1927–28.[41] Other sources mention Jaap
        Bulder, who also scored 67 goals in 1919–20 Netherlands Football League Championship but this tally includes four
        regional divisions and a final play-off round.
        9 goals scored in 2007 CAF Champions League and 10 goals in 2007 CAF Confederation Cup.
        Vivian Woodward scored 25 goals in 1909 including 14 goals for England national amateur football team.
        Torres scored in Premier League, FA Cup, Football League Cup, FA Community Shield, FIFA Club World Cup, UEFA Champions
        League and UEFA Europa League.
        It is commonly said that Stanley Matthews scored his final goal at the age of 50 years and 5 days but it is not true. He
        played his last match in English First Division at that age, achieving an assist.
        Stanley Matthews was 194 days younger when he last played in 1963–64 FA Cup scoring his last ever professional goal.[57]
        This match was not a full international (instead termed a "Victory international"). The U.S. Virgin Islander Keithroy
        Cornelius could be the record holder with a goal scored against Curaçao national football team with 43 years and 196
        days.[59]
        Excluding shoot-outs.
        Other sources show Zico as the footballer with more free kicks scored in history with 101.[66] Even Marcelinho Carioca
        could have that honour with 86 free kicks, depending on the source.[67]
        Counting only top matches, Pelé with 92 hat-tricks is the record holder.
        English goalkeeper Paul Bastock played 1,286 games in domestic club competition but this tally includes more than 149
        games in regional tournaments.[91]
        Including 210 games in Campeonato Mineiro and 71 games in Campeonato Carioca. If Brazil state leagues are not included,
        Peter Shilton would be the leader with the 848 games mentioned above.
        The Guinness World Records named, in 2023, David Mudge as the oldest competitive football player with 79 years and 89
        days. Nevertheless, he took part in a Northern Suburbs Football Association match, which is an Australian
        non-professional competition. Dickie Borthwick played his last game in December 2019 at the age of 83; he was member of
        a veterans league.[97]
        Israeli goalkeeper Isaak Hayik had entered the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest football player of all time at the
        age of 73 in 2019, playing a game in the fourth tier of the Israeli league.[100] In 2020, Egyptian Ezzeldin Bahader
        broke Hayik's record playing a game in Egyptian third tier at the age of 74.[101] None of them are professional players
        because they did not take part of the squad for the whole season.
        Salvador Reyes played the first 50 seconds of a Primera División de México Clausura 2008 match at the age of 71 but it
        was a tribute. He had been retired since he was 36.[99]
        Miura played a J.League Cup match later at the age of 54 years and 82 days, but the Emperor's Cup is the main cup
        competition in Japan.
        The Sercquiais Barrie Dewsbury played a game with 52 years and 11 days in 2003 but Sark football team is not recognised
        by FIFA.
        Mathieu Enguérran Edjekpan is claimed to be the youngest ever international footballer according to some sources, making
        his debut with Benin national team at the age of 13 years and 213 days, but his date of birth is not clear. Gali Freitas
        is claimed by the AFF to have debuted with East Timor on 1 September 2018 in a match against Brunei, aged 13 years and
        244 days. However, there is controversy whether he was born in 2004 or in 1996.[58][108] Souleymane Mamam is claimed by
        FIFA to have debuted with Togo in 2021 in a FIFA World Cup qualifier match, aged 13 years and 310 days. However, there
        is controversy whether he was born in 1987 or in 1985.[109][110] Abel Josiah Samson was also supposed to have played an
        international match with Tanzania national football team at 14 years old.[111]
        He is also the youngest footballer to ever take part in a professional football match.
        Paolo Maldini spent 31 years at Milan, including 6 years in Milan youth academy.
        Robert Carmona holds the Guinness World Record for the longest football career but his career includes lower leagues and
        amateur teams.[119]
        George Weah, James Debbah and Giorgos Koudas had an international career span of 32, 31 and 27 years long respectively
        but they all were given a farewell cameo appearance several years after their regular career had already ended. Billy
        Bohan, who played for the non-FIFA nor UEFA Alderney official football team, had an international career of 27 years and
        339 days.
        At top-level football, the most widely recognized record is Lionel Messi's 45 trophies.[124]
        Ángel Romano won six South American Championships and one Olympic Gold medal. Both Scarone and Nasazzi won four South
        American Championships, two Olympic Gold medals and one FIFA World Cup title.
        Sebastián Abreu has the Guinness World Record with 32 different teams, because the majority of the teams recognised to
        Frontini are in any case top-level clubs.[141][142]
        Tommy Ross holds the Guinness World Record for the fastest hat-trick scored on 28 November 1964 within 90 seconds.[149]
        Lángara won top scorer award with Real Club España in Mexico (CONCACAF) in 1944, 1946, Real Oviedo in Spain (UEFA) in
        1934, 1935, 1936 and San Lorenzo in Argentina (CONMEBOL) in 1940.
        With Manchester United (Premier League) in 2008; with Real Madrid (La Liga) in 2011, 2014 and 2015; with Juventus (Serie
        A) in 2021 and with Al Nassr (Saudi Pro League) in 2024.

        in 1993–94; Campeonato Brasileiro Série A in 2000, 2001 and 2005; USL First Division in 2006.
        If we don't count Brazil state leagues, Josef Bican would be the record holder with 14 top scorer awards. He won
        Austrian Championship in 1934; Czechoslovak First League in 1938, 1939, 1946, 1947, 1948 and 1950; Bohemian/Moravian
        league in 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943 and 1944; Czechoslovak Second League in 1949 and 1952.
        Imre Schlosser won 10 consecutive top scorer award in Hungarian National Championship between 1908 and 1917 but 1914 and
        1915 Championships are considered unofficial due to the World War.
        Paulo da Silva left Paraguayan club Atlántida in 1995 and returned in 2024, after 29 years.
        In two different periods, 1988–1990 and 2006–2021.
        Rudi Gutendorf holds the Guinness World Record for being in charge of 55 teams in 32 countries spanning six continental
        associations. Among them, he coached 18 different national teams but he only contested in official matches with 9 of
        them.[164][165]
        Willie Maley won 63 titles including fourteen Glasgow Cups and nineteen Glasgow Charity Cups, which are regional
        tournaments.
        Stábile won the Copa America with Argentina (1941, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1955, 1957), the Pan American Games (1951, 1955)
        and the Panamerican Championship (1960).
        Otto Rehhagel played for Hertha BSC until 1965 and coached the club in 2012, making a 47 years span between both calls.
        2 CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, 3 FIFA World Cups, 1 FIFA Confederations Cup, 1 Panamerican Championship, 16 Copa
        América.
        Some sources don't count this streak as a record because it comes from low-rated leagues; Arkadag itself has also been
        controversial since its fundation.[186] The official record belongs to Al Hilal.[187][188]
        Celtic also played in their unbeaten run, from 20 November 1915 to 14 April 1917, in two regional cups, the Glasgow
        Merchants Charity Cup and Glasgow Cup. Including two matches each in the 1915–16 Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup, in May
        1916,[191] and in the 1916–17 Glasgow Cup, in October 1916,[192] Celtic was unbeaten for 66 games.[190]
        Alderney official football team had a losing streak of 97 matches between 1921 and 2003, but their team it's not
        recognised by FIFA.
        The match was fixed, so we could add some other records in lower divisions worldwide.[199]
        54 penalties were needed to determin the winner of the match.
        Football World Championship, a competition between English and Scottish club champions, was created in 1886 but it was
        considered an exhibition association football match and it wasn't held annually.
        More than 20,000 at the District stage; only 50 of them are part of the National stage. On the other hand, more than
        5,000 teams participate in the French Cup every year, which is the largest competition worldwide.[221]
        Only two clubs contests the league: Woolpack Wanderers and the Garrison Gunners, playing each other eighteen times every
        season.
        The championship is played out in a tournament between the champions of the nine islands.
        On, 30 March 1946. It was a Division Three North Cup replay, after the first game ended 2–2 and as it would turn out,
        203 more minutes could not yield a victor. Tied once more at 2–2 after 90 minutes, the game between Stockport and
        Doncaster then went into extra time, but 30 more minutes were insufficient, with the two teams unable to score in that
        time period. The 'play to win' rule was commonplace in English football during the wartime period of the 1940s and it
        was a form of 'golden goal' – in essence, 'next goal wins'. Stockport thought they had clinched the winner on the 173rd

        played at the ground.
        Since it was remodelled in 2014 the official capacity is 114,000 spectators, which is also a record for a football
        pitch, but the stadium is still expandable up to 150,000.
        It was barely used for football matches and it only had 56,000 individual seats. It also had a field three times as long
        and three times as wide as the standard association football pitch.

        same institution contradicts itself.[238] According to other sources, there are other matches which are the record
        holders.
